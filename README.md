## *Project Description*
MindCare is a mental health support app that offers a unique blend of technology and human-like interaction. Leveraging the power of OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT, the app provides users with AI-driven support that mimics the experience of speaking to a psychiatrist.

The app aims to make mental health support more accessible and convenient for everyone.
